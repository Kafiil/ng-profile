        <p class="lead">
          My main strength is that I love programming, which makes what I do not only a job but also a passion. As part of my previous
          experiences, I've build a lot of websites and web applications mainly from scratch.
          <br> I code with C# but also Java. I'm very comfortable around .NET technologies such as ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server,
          Entity framework...
          <br>I also use bootstrap, javascript jquery and other Javascript technologies such as AngularJS and React ...
          <br> If you ever need a reliable resource that would get the job done in a convenient period of time, then I guess
          I am your man :)
